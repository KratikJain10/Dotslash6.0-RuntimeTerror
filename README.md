DOTSLASH6.0
We initially thought of budget tracker but due to it's lack of feasibility we shifted to another project.
We basically aimed to build a website "FITCITY" that tells if a city is worth living or not.
It compares various essential parameters to judge a city and finally tells the user the condition of the city.
It uses different APIs for the data.
